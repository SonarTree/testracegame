This to-do list outlines the next steps for enhancing your 3D racing game. The focus is on adding more engaging features, improving the user experience, and refining the existing code.

Phase 1: Core Gameplay Enhancements
Objective: To make the racing experience more dynamic and challenging.

To-Do List:

[x] Implement Drifting Mechanics:

Add a drift state when the player turns sharply at high speed.
Visualize the drift with tire marks and a change in car handling.
Consider adding a "boost" reward for successful drifts.
[ ] Add Power-ups:

Create a PowerUp class with different types (e.g., Speed Boost, Shield, Obstacle).
Randomly spawn power-up items on the track for players to collect.
Implement the logic for each power-up's effect.
[ ] Refine Collision Physics:

Instead of just stopping the car on collision, implement a more realistic bounce-back effect. The angle and force of the collision should determine the car's reaction.
[x] More Dynamic Camera:

Add a slight "shake" or "rumble" effect to the camera when the car is at max speed or collides with objects.
Experiment with different camera angles or a "cinematic" start-of-race camera.
Phase 2: AI and Opponent Behavior
Objective: To make the AI opponent more competitive and lifelike.

To-Do List:

[ ] Improve AI Pathfinding:

The current AI follows a simple waypoint system. Enhance this by making the AI's path less predictable. You could add some slight randomness to their line or have them react to the player's position.
Implement "rubber banding" to keep the race competitive, where the AI might slow down if it's too far ahead or speed up if it's too far behind.
[ ] Add More AI Opponents:

Modify the code to support multiple AI cars, each with potentially slightly different driving styles or speeds.
Phase 3: UI/UX and Audio
Objective: To create a more polished and immersive user experience.

To-Do List:

[ ] Add a Minimap:

Create a 2D representation of the track and display the positions of the player and AI cars in real-time.
[ ] Sound Effects:

Integrate basic sound effects for:
Engine sounds (idle, accelerating, max speed)
Collisions
Drifting
Picking up power-ups
Crossing the finish line
[ ] On-Screen Notifications:

Display messages like "Wrong Way!" if the player is going in the wrong direction, or "Final Lap!"
[ ] Main Menu/Game States:

Create a simple main menu scene before the race starts.
Implement a proper "Game Over" or "Race Finished" screen that shows final times and positions.
Phase 4: Graphics and Performance
Objective: To improve the visual quality and ensure the game runs smoothly.

To-Do List:

[ ] More Detailed Car Model:

Replace the current box-like car with a more detailed 3D model. You can find free models online or create your own.
[ ] Environment and Track Details:

Add more visual elements to the track, such as trees, grandstands, or different textures for the ground and walls.
Implement a skybox for a more realistic sky.
[ ] Particle Effects:

Add particle effects for exhaust smoke, sparks on collision, and dust from the tires.
Phase 5: Code Quality and Refactoring
Objective: To make the code more organized and easier to maintain.

To-Do List:

[ ] Refactor main.ts:

The main.ts file is getting large. Break down the code into separate classes or modules for:
PlayerCar
AICar
Track
GameUI
Physics
[ ] State Management:

Implement a more robust game state manager (e.g., MainMenu, Playing, Paused, GameOver) to handle the flow of the game, instead of the current gameStarted boolean.
[ ] Configuration File:

Move hardcoded values like car speed, acceleration, and friction into a separate configuration file or object for easier tweaking.
