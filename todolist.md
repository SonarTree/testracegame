3D Racing Game Project Plan & To-Do List (Cursor AI Focused)
This project plan outlines the key phases and tasks for developing a simple 3D racing game entirely within a Cursor AI environment. The goal is to leverage AI capabilities for rapid prototyping and content generation.

Project Goal:
To create a playable, simple 3D racing game with basic controls, a track, and an opponent, demonstrating the capabilities of Cursor AI in game development.

Phases and To-Do List:
Phase 1: Planning & Setup (Initial AI Prompts)
Objective: Define core game mechanics and prepare the AI environment.

Duration: 1-2 days

To-Do List:

1.1 Game Concept & Scope Definition:

Define core gameplay loop (Race -> Finish -> Restart).

Determine target platform (web-based, within AI environment).

Outline minimum viable features (1 car, 1 track, basic controls, 1 AI opponent).

AI Prompt Idea: "Generate a high-level game design document for a simple 3D racing game, focusing on core mechanics, user interface elements, and a simple control scheme."

[x] 1.2 Initial AI Environment Setup:

Verify necessary libraries/frameworks (e.g., Three.js for 3D, if the AI supports it, or pure canvas rendering).

Set up the basic HTML/JS structure.

AI Prompt Idea: "Create a basic HTML file with a canvas element and a JavaScript setup for a Three.js scene, including a camera, renderer, and a simple cube to verify 3D rendering."

1.3 Version Control Strategy (within AI context):

Determine how to save iterations and revert if needed (e.g., copy-pasting code outputs, using AI's conversational history as a pseudo-version log).

Phase 2: Core Game Mechanics (Iterative AI Generation)
Objective: Implement fundamental game elements.

Duration: 3-5 days

To-Do List:

[x] 2.1 Player Car & Controls:

Model/create a simple 3D car asset (e.g., a box or basic extruded shape).

Implement basic movement (forward, backward, steering).

Ensure responsive controls.

AI Prompt Idea: "Generate JavaScript code for a Three.js scene that includes a simple box as a player car. Implement keyboard controls (W, A, S, D or arrow keys) for movement and rotation. Ensure smooth camera follow."

[x] 2.2 Racing Track:

Design a simple track layout (e.g., a flat plane with walls).

Implement collision detection with track boundaries.

AI Prompt Idea: "Create a basic 3D racing track in Three.js, consisting of a plane and simple block walls. Add collision detection between the player car and these walls, preventing the car from passing through them."

[x] 2.3 Basic Physics (Simplified):

Implement acceleration, deceleration, and basic turning physics.

AI Prompt Idea: "Enhance the car movement code to include basic acceleration, braking, and steering physics, so the car doesn't instantly stop or turn. Consider factors like friction (simple dampening)."

Phase 3: Game Features & Enhancements
Objective: Add essential game features.

Duration: 2-3 days

To-Do List:

[x] 3.1 AI Opponent:

Implement a simple AI path-following system (e.g., predefined waypoints).

AI Prompt Idea: "Develop a simple AI opponent for the racing game. The AI car should follow a predefined path (list of coordinates) around the track. Implement basic speed control for the AI."

[x] 3.2 Lap Counting & Timer:

Implement a system to count laps.

Add a timer for lap times and total race time.

AI Prompt Idea: "Add functionality to the racing game to detect when the player completes a lap. Implement a lap counter and a race timer displayed on the screen. Reset the lap timer for each new lap."

[x] 3.3 Start/Finish Line:

Visually represent the start/finish line.

Trigger lap counting upon crossing.

AI Prompt Idea: "Create a visual start/finish line in the Three.js scene. Implement logic so that crossing this line updates the lap counter and records lap times."

[x] 3.4 Basic UI Elements:

Display lap counter, timer, speed.

Simple start/restart buttons.

AI Prompt Idea: "Design a basic HTML/CSS overlay for the racing game's UI. It should display the current lap, race time, and player speed. Include a 'Start Race' and 'Restart' button."

Phase 4: Refinement & Polish
Objective: Improve the game's presentation and playability.

Duration: 1-2 days

To-Do List:

[x] 4.1 Visual Improvements:

Basic lighting (ambient, directional).

Simple textures or colors for car and track.

AI Prompt Idea: "Enhance the visual appeal of the Three.js racing scene by adding basic lighting (e.g., a directional light and ambient light). Apply simple color materials to the car and track elements."

[x] 4.2 Performance Optimization (AI assistance):

Identify and address simple performance bottlenecks.

AI Prompt Idea: "Analyze the current Three.js code for potential performance improvements, such as optimizing geometry or draw calls. Suggest and implement minor optimizations."

[x] 4.3 Bug Fixing & Testing:

Identify and fix any gameplay bugs.

Test controls, collisions, lap counting thoroughly.

AI Prompt Idea: "Review the racing game's code for common bugs related to collision detection, car movement, or UI updates. Suggest fixes for any identified issues."
