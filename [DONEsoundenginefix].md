[DONE] Option 3: Advanced Prompt for Nuanced Sound Control
This prompt aims for a slightly better user experience, ensuring the sound doesn't abruptly cut off if the car is still moving.

"Let's refine the engine sound logic in src/Game.ts to make it more realistic. The sound should only play when the player is actively accelerating or when the car is still coasting at a significant speed.

Here are the steps:

In the startGame method, remove the line this.soundManager.playSound('engine'); to prevent the sound from auto-playing.
In the update method, add logic to control the engine sound. The sound should play if the player is pressing 'w' or 's' OR if the car's speed (this.vehicle.speed) is above a small threshold (e.g., 0.1).
If neither of those conditions is met (the player is not pressing a key and the car has slowed to a near-stop), then the engine sound should be stopped.
This will create a more natural effect where the engine sound fades out as the car coasts to a stop."
